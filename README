This package is intended to do the following ( assumption - calculating EXACT log-likelihood is expensive ):
1. Get some data set of (location ,  exact log-likelihood) pairs. log-likelihood given up to an additive constant.
2. Perform gausiian processs regression (a.k.a KRIGING)* to estimate log-likelihood on entire state space.
3. Sample from the estimated log-likelihood.
4. Calculate  exact log-likelihood.
5. Add new (location, exact log-likelihood) pair to data set.
6. Goto 1 until you've had enough.
7. Sample from the posterior estimated log-likelihood.

*The algorithm used is either the one is page 257 of [1] ("augmented covariance matrix") or algorithm 2.1 in page 19 of [2] ("Rasmussen Williams). You get to choose.

Start by typing running any of the graphical tests (movie, plots). Then come back here and check these notes before you really delve into the code:

1. Whenever I refer to a "container object", I mean an instance of the class 'Config' in the  'kernel.config' module. Usually an instance is called CFG.
 
2. You have a container object. Sampling from the posterior it defines is done by: 
newSample = kernel.sampler.sampler( container object )

3. To put data inside the a containetr object use  its 'addPair(x, f)' method.


important variables (whose value is stored in a container object):
-----------------------------------------------------------------
r - a characteristic length scale, determines the autocovariance of the (presumably) underlying gaussian process.
See 'kernel.aux' module. 
Set it using a container's 'setR' method.

M - the size of the box where we "clip" the probability. if |x|_inf > M then P(x) = 0 ( equivalently: log P(x) = -inf ).
See 'lnprob' method in 'kernel.sampler' module. 
Set it using a container's 'setM' method.

LL- the TRUE log-likelihood. Set it to whatever procedure you have for calculating log-likelihood.
See 'sampler' method in 'kernel.sampler' module.
Set it using a container's 'setLL' method.

addSamplesToDataSet - used when we train the sampler. After we've incorporated samples to data set (with their TRUE log likelihood) we may sample from the posterior.
See last 'if' clause in 'sampler' method in 'kernel.sampler' module.
Set it using a container's 'setAddSamplesToDataSet' method.

type - a class that tells you what kind of gaussian process regression algorithm a container is using. In a container object the pointer variable is 'algType'.
See the 'kernel.type' module.
Set it using a container's 'setType' method.
