    This will be referred to as a container class. It holds all
    the data needed to do kriging, resample etc. An instance of 
    this class is passed to the sampler, the kriging procedure
    etc.
    This module does not do heavy computations, that is left for the 
    kriging module. Here we store data and run specifications.
