Feel free to write to me about my code!

This module creates static classes that are used as flags
The user (you!) SHOULD NOT create new instances of these classes
'''

class Type(object):
    '''
    a static class with the instances seen below.
    Do NOT create instances of this class on your own, this is NOT what this
    class is built for. The instances on the bottom are a substitute
    for a flag.
